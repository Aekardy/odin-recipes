        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Cut the tops off the tomatoes and carefully scoop out the pulp and seeds to create a hollow space inside. Reserve the pulp for later.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat oil in a large skillet or pan over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and diced potatoes. Saute until the potatoes are golden and tender, about 10-15 minutes.
                Season with salt and pepper to taste.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the meantime beat 1/4<sup>th</sup> of the eggs in a bowl and add the reserved tomato pulp. Mix well.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the potatoes and onions are cooked, mix them with the egg and tomato pulp mixture.
            </li>
            <li>
                Carefully fill each hollowed out tomato with the egg, potato and onion mixture.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat remaining oil in the same skillet over medium heat. Place the stuffed tomatoes in the skillet.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cover the skillet and cook the stuffed tomatoes for about 15-20 minutes, or until the tomatoes are tender, and the egg filling is set.
                You may need to rotate the tomatoes gently to ensure even cooking.
            </li>
            <li>
                While the stuffed tomatoes are cooking, fry the remaining eggs in a separate pan to desired level of doneness.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the stuffed tomatoes are done, remove them from the skillet and place a fried egg on top of each one.
            </li>
            <li>
