        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Spread peanut butter on two slices of bread and then create a sandwich with the remaining slices.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a shallow bowl, beat the eggs until well combined.
            </li>
            <li>
                Dip each sandwich into the beaten eggs, ensuring both the sides are coated evenly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat butter or oil in a skillet over medium heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place the egg-coated sandwiches in the skillet and cook for a few minutes on each side until they are golden brown and the egg coating is cooked through.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove the sandwiches from the skillet and let them cool slightly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cut each sandwich into halves or quarters, creating smaller pieces for serving.
            </li>
            <li>
                Optionally, drizzle some maple syrup or honey over the sandwich toast.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve with fresh fruit on the side, if desired.
